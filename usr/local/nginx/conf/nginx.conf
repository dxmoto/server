	# «`fastcgi_buffer_size` is a special buffer space used to hold the first part of the FastCGI response,
	# which is going to be the HTTP response headers.
	#
	# You shouldn't need to adjust this from the default -
	# even if Nginx defaults to the smallest page size of 4KB (your platform will determine if 4/8k buffer)
	# it should fit your typical HTTP header.
	#
	# The one exception I have seen are frameworks that push large amounts of cookie data
	# via the Set-Cookie HTTP header during their user verification/login phase -
	# blowing out the buffer and resulting in a HTTP 500 error.
	# In those instances you will need to increase this buffer to 8k/16k/32k
	# to fully accommodate your largest upstream HTTP header being pushed.»
